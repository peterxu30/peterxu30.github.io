					This semester I'm taking a DeCal, a student taught course, called The Art of Erhu where we learn how to play the erhu, also known as the Chinese violin. I just had my first class on Monday and got my instrument all set up. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I've always known about the erhu but never really had much interest in it until now. Not gonna lie, it was the <i>Legend of Korra</i> soundtrack and its use of the erhu that really got me intrigued. I never knew the instrument could sound so beautiful. Luckily for me, when I googled "erhu berkeley", there just happened to be a beginner class offered at Cal.  
				</p>
				<p>
					I don't expect to be a master by the end of the semester; if I can hold it properly by the end, I consider that a victory. Nonetheless, it is great to pick up an instrument and try something new. College is a time to just get out there and experiment, a lesson I didn't really learn last semester. For now, I must memorize Chinese music notation in preparation of the playing techniques to come next class. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Lastly, for all you poor souls out there who have yet to be blessed by the glory that is the <i>Legend of Korra</i>, give this song a listen:<br><a href = "https://soundcloud.com/jeremy-zuckerman/the-legend-of-korra"> soundcloud.com/jeremy-zuckerman/the-legend-of-korra</a>. <br>It's the song that started this whole adventure for me.
