				<p>
					Hello! <br> <br>
					This is my first blog post and it shall serve as an introduction to this blog. As you may now well suspect, I am Peter Xu, a student at the University of California, Berkeley studying computer science.  
				</p>
				<p>
					This blog is meant to be a rather casual affair where I can write about anything that comes to mind. I have always enjoyed writing but I’m afraid I haven’t been writing as much these days. Hopefully this blog will keep my abilities from growing stale. 
				</p>
				<p>
					As of now, this website is functional, but there is a lot of under the hood functionality that I hope to add. If I succeed in my endeavors, I may post here what I’ve done and how I did it.
				</p>
				<p>
					But for now, I’ll take this opportunity of being in a more informal environment to introduce myself, the self that isn’t reflected in my resume.
				</p>
				<p>
					I enjoy running, eating, reading, gaming, and writing. I’m a big fan of <i>League of Legends</i>, both the game itself and its professional scene. As a mid-silver ad carry, I’m not quite pro material but I have fun nonetheless. I don’t watch television often, but I absolutely love <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i> and <i>The Legend of Korra</i>. In my spare time, I tend to doodle on just about anything I can get my hands on; my high school desks were a frequent canvas. In junior year, it reached the point where my history teacher had to tell me to stop drawing on the desk. Sadly, all those years of practice have not amounted to much; to this day, stick figures remain my bread and butter. 
					<br> <br>
					That just about wraps up this post. Thanks for reading, I hope there’s more to come.
