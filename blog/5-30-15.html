					Wow, I started writing this post on May 3rd, and only now on May 30th am I finishing it. Hope this blog doesn't call the protective services to report neglect. 
				</p>
				<p>
					It has been a long time since my last post. In fact, it’s been almost an entire semester. Pretty sure I’m the only one to have ever laid eyes upon this blog, but that’s okay. This can be my public online diary.
				</p>
				<p>
					Much has happened this semester. I’ve learned to play the erhu at a mediocre level, worked late into the night on CS projects, and made friends along the way. Whether I am wiser remains debatable.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the start of this semester, I applied and joined Upsilon Pi Epsilon, the CS honors society, as an initiate. Now a fully fledged member, I decided to give officer elections a shot and was elected publicity chair. I’ll be in charge of publicizing the clubs various events. This mainly entails designing fliers in Photoshop and publicizing through social media. I’ve always enjoyed using Photoshop to make fun things, I just get to call it a job now. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Academically, this past semester was harder than I expected, but it is over now. Luckily, on the last day of instruction I did decide to file a declaration petition for CS. With all my grades out, I’ve met the early declaration GPA threshold, so hopefully, I get notification in the near future regarding my admittance into the major.
